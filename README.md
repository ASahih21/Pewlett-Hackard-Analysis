## Project Overview:

 Employees at Pewlett Hacker at different levels are approaching retirement. Since, most of these employee hold key positions, there is a need to plan for knowledge and experience transters. We are tasked with determining the number of retiring employees by their titles, and identify current ones that become eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We will present, below, the result of our analysis and prepare management for the “silver tsunami”, as they put it

## Data gathering approach

We created scripts to manually build the tables needed and load them with raw data that our client has provided. Data consistency and integrity shaped the design and structures of the tables.

We used advanced SQL concepts to extract information about the employees eligible for retirement, the positions and unique titles they hold. Finally, we looked at those eligible to take the reign.

## Analysis

based on the data we collected we attempt to answer the following questions: 

Q- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?. 
A - We found,A total of 90398 employees would be impacted" and they are all roles that will require immediate consideration as to filling them.


Q- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?.

A- Short answer is yes there are. However, we find that the number of mentors that are about to retire is bigger then the employees that needs mentorship.

## Conclusion

We believe that we have provided enough data to the manager and assist him in his decision. There are quite a number of employees that fall within the retiring data ranges used in this analysis. We would also reiterate a fact that we observed and documented: the number of employees flagged for mentorship seem small.
